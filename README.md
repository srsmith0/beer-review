# Live, Laugh, Lager

This is a beer review app that allows users to review beers, add beer related posts, and find breweries near them. I always found it incredibly frustrating as a brewer that other beer rating apps only required an overall rating for a beer score.  So I require a user to rate 4 critera and the app creates the overall score.  It uses a third party API and reviews and posts have all CRUD actions.
